TOP project: TODO List 

12/19 1349: after a few days of going down the rabbit hole of overly complicated buttonActions array problems. Simplified things and making headway. Created Website1.js and function modules for import.  At this point masterList, addCategory, addTask generate proper buttons.  Add buttons work.
